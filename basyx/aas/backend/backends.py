This module provides a registry and and abstract base class for Backends. A :class:`~.Backend` is a class that allows to
synchronize Referable AAS objects or their included data with external data sources such as a remote API or a local
source for real time data. Each backend provides access to one kind of data source.

The data source of an individual object is specified as an URI in its :attr:`~basyx.aas.model.base.Referable.source`
attribute. The schema part of that URI defines the type of data source and, in consequence, the backend class to use
for synchronizing this object.

Custom backends for additional types of data sources can be implemented by subclassing the `Backend` class and
implementing the :meth:`~.Backend.commit_object` and :meth:`~.Backend.update_object` class methods. These are used
internally by the objects' :meth:`~basyx.aas.model.base.Referable.update` and :meth:`~basyx.aas.model.base.Referable.commit`
methods when the backend is applicable for the relevant source URI. Then, the Backend class
needs to be registered to handle update/commit requests for a specific URI schema, using
:meth:`~aas.backend.backends.register_backend`.

    Each Backend class is typically capable of synchronizing (updating/committing) objects with a type of external data

    from this class and be registered via :meth:`~aas.backend.backends.register_backend`. to be used by Referable
