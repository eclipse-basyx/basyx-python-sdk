# Eclipse BaSyx Python SDK

(formerly known as PyI40AAS – Python Industry 4.0 Asset Administration Shell)

The Eclipse BaSyx Python project focuses on providing a Python implementation of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) 
for Industry 4.0 Systems. 
These are the currently implemented specifications:

## Features
This repository is structured into separate packages. 
The `sdk` directory provides the AAS metamodel as Python objects and fundamental functionalities to handle AAS.
The `server` implements a specification-compliant Docker HTTP server for AASs.
The `compliance_tool` is to be determined.

* [SDK](./sdk/README.md):
  * Modelling of AASs as Python objects
  * Reading and writing of AASX package files
  * (De-)serialization of AAS objects into/from JSON and XML
  * Experimental serialization to RDF (see branch [Experimental/Adapter/RDF](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-python-sdk/tree/Experimental/Adapter/RDF/basyx/aas/adapter/rdf)).
    Please refer to discussion of PR [#308](https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-python-sdk/pull/308) for the reasoning behind keeping this feature experimental. 
  * Storing of AAS objects in CouchDB, Backend infrastructure for easy expansion 
  * Compliance checking of AAS XML and JSON files
* [Server](./server/README.md): Docker Image of a specification compliant HTTP Server implementing the interfaces:
  * Asset Administration Shell Repository
  * Submodel Repository
* [Compliance Tool](./compliance_tool/README.md): A command-line tool for checking compliance of JSON and XML files
  to the specification of the AAS
