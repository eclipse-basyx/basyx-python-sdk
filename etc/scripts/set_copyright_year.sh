# Usage: ./set_copyright_year.sh [PATHS]
#
# This is a small script for setting the correct copyright year
# for each given file (i.e. the year the file was last changed).
# Instead of file paths you can also specify directories, in which
# case the script will attempt to set the copyright year for all
# files in the given directories. Globbing is also possible.
#
# The script will check the first two lines for a copyright
# notice (in case the first line is a shebang).
#
# Run this script with --check to have it raise an error if it
# would change anything.


# Set CHECK_MODE based on whether --check is passed
