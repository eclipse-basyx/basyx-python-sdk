basyx.aas.model - Python Model of the AssetAdministrationShell Metamodel
========================================================================

.. automodule:: basyx.aas.model

.. note::
    Since the Class-Attributes usually have the same names as the ``__init__``-constructor
    parameters, you can assume that you can use the attribute names listed in the documentation for
    initiating the class. If there is discrepancy between the two, it should be stated so.
